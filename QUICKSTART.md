# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

## For Hackathon Judges & Evaluators

### ⚡ Fastest Way to Run the Demo (3 steps)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy pyttsx3
   ```

2. **Run the demo:**
   ```powershell
   python demo.py
   ```

3. **Test detection:**
   - Point camera at the floor/ground
   - Place objects in front of camera (books, shoes, etc.)
   - Watch colored bounding boxes appear
   - Listen for audio warnings

**That's it!** The system will automatically download the AI model on first run.

## 📡 ESP32-CAM Wireless Mode (NEW!)

Use an **ESP32-CAM module** for wireless video streaming:

### Quick Setup:
1. **Setup ESP32-CAM** (see `esp32_cam/README.md` for full instructions):
   - Upload firmware using Arduino IDE
   - Configure WiFi credentials
   - Note the IP address shown in Serial Monitor

2. **Test the stream:**
   ```powershell
   python test_esp32_stream.py http://192.168.1.100:81/stream
   ```
   (Replace `192.168.1.100` with your ESP32-CAM's IP)

3. **Run with ESP32-CAM:**
   ```powershell
   python main.py --source http://192.168.1.100:81/stream
   ```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Wireless/portable operation
- ✅ Low cost ($10-15)
- ✅ Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- ✅ Perfect for wearable/mobile deployment

**See `esp32_integration.md` for complete guide and performance tuning.**

## 📋 What to Look For During Demo

### ✅ Core Features

1. **Real-time Detection**
   - Colored bounding boxes around objects
   - Labels showing object type and distance
   - Green (far) → Orange (near) → Red (immediate)

2. **Intelligent Audio**
   - System only announces the MOST critical hazard
   - Directional guidance: "left", "right", "directly ahead"
   - Distance callouts: "2 meters", "5 meters"
   - Won't spam you with every object

3. **Custom Hazard Detection**
   - Detects stairs using horizontal line detection
   - Identifies dark spots as potential potholes
   - Works even without custom training data

4. **Sidewalk Edge Detection**
   - Cyan lines show detected edges
   - Warns when getting too close to edge
   - "Shore-lining" keeps user on safe path

5. **Performance**
   - 30+ FPS on laptop
   - Real-time with minimal lag
   - Responsive to camera movement

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Obstacle
**Setup:** Place one object on floor in front of camera

**Expected Result:**
- Red/orange bounding box
- Audio: "DANGER/Caution: [object] directly ahead, X meters"

### Scenario 2: Multiple Obstacles (The Wow Factor!)
**Setup:** 
- Place object close to camera (books)
- Have person stand far away in background

**Expected Result:**
- System detects both
- Only announces the CLOSE object (intelligent filtering!)
- Far person is shown but not announced

### Scenario 3: Clear Path
**Setup:** Point camera at empty floor

**Expected Result:**
- No bounding boxes
- Audio: "Path clear for 5 meters" (every ~2 seconds)

### Scenario 4: Edge Detection
**Setup:** Place tape line on floor, walk toward it

**Expected Result:**
- Cyan line appears along the edge
- Audio warning when getting close: "Approaching sidewalk edge on [side]"

## ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

### Make it More/Less Sensitive

Edit `config.py`:

```python
# More sensitive (detect more objects)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.3

# Less sensitive (only obvious objects)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6
```

### Change Audio Frequency

```python
# More frequent announcements
ANNOUNCEMENT_COOLDOWN = 1.5  # seconds

# Less frequent
ANNOUNCEMENT_COOLDOWN = 5.0
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'ultralytics'"
```powershell
pip install ultralytics
```

### "Could not open video source"
Camera in use by another app. Close other programs and try:
```powershell
python main.py --source 0
```

Or use a video file:
```powershell
python main.py --source path/to/video.mp4
```

### No detections appearing
Lower the confidence:
```powershell
python main.py --confidence 0.3
```

### Audio not working
System will still show visual bounding boxes and labels. Audio is supplementary.

Check:
```powershell
pip install pyttsx3
```

### Slow/Laggy
GPU not being used. This is OK for demo - YOLOv8-nano is optimized for CPU.

To check GPU:
```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print True if GPU available
```

## ⭐ Key Message

This isn't just detecting objects - it's providing **context-aware, intelligent navigation assistance** that conventional GPS cannot offer. It's the missing piece for truly accessible urban navigation.

**Ready to demo!** 🎉
